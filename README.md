# EletroPy

This is a Python program that reads excel files from an eletrophysiology machine, analyses them and exports the results needed in an accessible way. I made it for my girlfriend, who is currently a Neuroscience Master's student. The goal with it was to provide an user-friendly solution that could simplify her tasks of analysing each sample‚Äôs data for one of the techniques used in her thesis.
